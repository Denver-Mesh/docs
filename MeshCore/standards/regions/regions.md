The following short-codes are based on "Major" airports: https://flightmath.com/airports-in-colorado, as this ensures country-wide uniqueness, which is required on the mesh. 
This is also why some three-letter codes aren't perhaps the best abbreviation of the region's name.

The two-letter abbreviations are based on the state postal codes, and should not conflict with any three-letter airport/IATA codes.

The `mnw` code, used here to refer to the Mountain West region, does not clash with any current IATA code, and should be considered safe to use for the foreseeable future.
