# Denver MeshCore Naming Standard v2.1

## Part 1: Infrastructure

All names: 23 character max (hard limit)

#### Format: `[REGION]-[CITY]-[LANDMARK]-[TYPE]-[PUBKEY]`

- `REGION` - A 3-character code for the general area. We use the IATA code of the nearest airport, as these are widely
  recognized and unique across the country (see below).
- `CITY` — Up to 5 chars
- `LANDMARK` — Up to 5 chars (park, intersection, etc.)
- `TYPE` — Node type (see below)
- `PUBKEY` — The first 4 characters of the node's public key, for identification and uniqueness.

If landmark is prominent, `CITY` can be dropped, and `LANDMARK` gets up to 11 characters.

Regular expression patterns:

- With city: `^[A-Z]{3}-[A-Z]{1,5}-[A-Z0-9\.\+\_\|]{1,5}-[A-Z]{2}-[A-F0-9]{4}$`
- Without city: `^[A-Z]{3}-[A-Z0-9\.\+\_\|]{1,11}-[A-Z]{2}-[A-F0-9]{4}$`

`REGION`, `CITY` and `TYPE` should always be expressed in all uppercase letters.

`LANDMARK` can be uppercase or lowercase to help with multi-word readability (e.g. `RdRcks` vs `RDRCKS`)

`PUBKEY` can be either all uppercase or all lowercase.

The `-` hyphen character should be used as block separators.

##### Examples:

- `DEN-DNVR-CHSPK-RC-9F2E` - Core repeater, Cheesman Park
- `DEN-DNVR-SLOAN-RE-9F2E` - Edge repeater, Sloan's Lake
- `DEN-LKWD-GRNMT-RD-9F2E` - Dist repeater, Green Mountain
- `DEN-REDROCKS-RC-9F2E` - Core repeater, Red Rocks (no city)
- `COS-PIKESPEAK-RC-9F2E` - Core repeater, Pikes Peak (no city)
- `DEN-DNVR-RINO-TS-9F2E` - Room server, RiNo

#### Region Codes:

The `REGION` block uses the 3-character IATA code of the nearest major airport.

See the following Wikipedia page; we ONLY use IATA codes for airports in the "Commercial service - primary airports"
and "Commercial service - nonprimary airports" categories: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_airports_in_Colorado

#### City Codes:

- `DENVR`
- `AURRA`
- `LKWD`
- `ARVDA`
- `WSTMR`
- `THRTN`
- `CENTL`
- `BROOM`
- `LTTN`
- `ENGL`
- `CMRCE`
- `GLDN`
- `BOULR`
- `PARKR`
- `CSTLR`
- `HGHLN`
- `CSPRG`
- `LSVL`
- `LFYTE`
- `LVLND`

A complete list of city codes for all Colorado cities is being discussed and prepared.

Cities should contain between 1 and 5 alphabetic characters only.

#### Landmark Examples:

- `CHSPK` - Cheesman Park
- `SLOAN` - Sloan's Lake
- `WSHPK` - Washington Park
- `RINO` - RiNo Arts District
- `LODO` - Lower Downtown (LoDo)
- `CPHIL` - Cap Hill
- `UNION` - Union Station
- `CLFAX` - Colfax Avenue
- `RDRKS` - Red Rocks
- `16ST` - 16th Street Mall
- `DIA` - Denver International Airport
- `SR+25` - Speer + I-25 intersection

Landmarks should contain between 1 and 5 (11 if no city) alphanumeric characters and the following special characters
only.

The following special characters are allowed:

- `+` (for intersections or "and", e.g. `SR+25`)
- `.` (as a separator/space replacement, e.g. `16.ST`)
- `_` (as a separator/space replacement, e.g. `16_ST`)
- `|` (to separate multiple items, e.g. `16TH|STAPLE`)

The following special characters are **NOT** allowed:

- `-` - Hyphens are reserved for block separation and should not be used within the blocks themselves.
- `&` - Does not render properly on some devices and can cause issues in URLs. Use `+` instead
- ` ` - Spaces are not allowed in node names. Use `-`, `.`, or `_` instead.
- `/` or `\` - Can cause issues in URLs and file paths. Use `+` instead.
- `@` - Does not render properly on some devices and can cause issues in URLs. Avoid using in landmark names.
- `,` - Can cause issues in CSV exports and some databases. Also confused with decimal points/periods.
- `'` - Often unnecessary when space is already limited.

#### Node Types:

- `RC`: Core Repeater — Backbone. Mountain/tower. Battery backup.
- `RD`: Distribution Rpt — Bridges core to edge. Suburban elevated.
- `RE`: Edge Repeater — Rooftop/residential. Mains power OK.
- `RM`: Mobile Repeater — Vehicle or temporary.
- `TS`: Room Server — Fixed location.
- `TM`: Mobile Room — Location changes.
- `TR`: Room + Repeat — Room server w/ repeat on.

#### Public Key Prefix

Every node (repeater and companion) on the local mesh should have a unique 4-character code for identification.

This code is the first 4 characters of the node's public key.

It is important that this is unique across the mesh as this is used for identification and in route tracing. Avoid using
the same prefix on multiple nodes.

**NOTE:** At time of writing, MeshCore uses the first 2 characters of the public key as the prefix (limited to 256
unique prefixes). Work is underway to expand this to 4 characters in the future (65,536 unique prefixes). In
anticipation of this change, we are embracing 4 characters as the standard for new nodes, to ensure uniqueness and
future-proofing.

#### Other Settings

##### Ownership

Please do not put emojis in your repeater names. Not only do they eat 2+ bytes from the naming schema, they also don't
render properly on all firmware.

Instead, set the ownership field in your repeater settings to `@yourdiscordname` (requires firmware 1.12.0+). Please
note that this information is visible to all mes users, so do not put any personally identifiable information here if
you are concerned about privacy.

##### Region Setting

Set your repeater's region setting to match its IATA airport code.

### Changes From v2.0

- `LANDMARK` block can be a combination of uppercase and lowercase characters
- `PUBKEY` block can be all uppercase or all lowercase characters

## Part 2: Companions

**NOTE:** The following is unchanged from v1.1.

All names: 23 character max (hard limit)

#### Format: `[EMOJI] [HANDLE] [##]`

- `EMOJI` — One per person. Same on all your nodes. Claim in channel. First come, first served.
- `HANDLE` — Your mesh alias. Not your real name. Nodes broadcast GPS — real name + location is a bad combo.
- `##` — Number by purpose starting at `01`, or use first 2 chars of pub key.

Examples:

- `👻 M3SHGHØST 01` - Primary carry node
- `👻 M3SHGHØST 02` - Home base node
- `👻 M3SHGHØST 03` - Vehicle node
- `🐿️ SQRLNUT 01` - Primary companion
- `🔥 BURNR F4` - Companion (key prefix suffix)
- `🏔️ PKBAGGER 01` - Primary companion

**Number by purpose, not hardware**. Swap devices, keep the name.

**DO NOT:**

- Use your real name
- Put hardware in the name
- Use different emojis per device — one emoji per person
- Take someone else's emoji
- Go over 23 characters

Community Tracking — Keep a shared list (pinned post/wiki) for:

- Emoji claims
- City/landmark abbreviations
- Deployed node names
- Claimed pub key prefixes

Check the list before deploying. Post in channel if adding something new.
